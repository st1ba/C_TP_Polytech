# C Exercises - Polytech Paris‑Saclay

This repository contains my C exercises and practical assignments completed as part of courses at Polytech Paris‑Saclay.

Typical structure:
- /exos/      : folders for each exercise
- /tp/        : practical labs
- Makefile    : build rules (if present)
- README      : this file

Compilation and execution (example):
- gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 src/my_program.c -o my_program
- ./my_program

Notes:
- Personal work for review and learning.
- Feel free to add clear commits and comments in the code.
